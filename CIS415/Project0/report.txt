The structure of the StringList and AnagramList is understandable to me. The list contain a pointer store the word and a pointer which
point to the next point. This is basic idea of the StringList, and the list will end if the pointer next is NULL. The structure of the 
AnagramList is similar. I think all the function in the header file will be understandable if we can follow this sturcture to complete
the functions. The things I worried about are sorting and comparing. The good thing is that I found strcmp() and qsort() and these two
methods can help me do the quicksort and comparsion easily, but I actually had some issues about reading and writing files. I couldn't 
open the .dict file currently and this caused my main function couldn't work well. The only way I can test my code is using txt file for 
testing, instead of dic file.
